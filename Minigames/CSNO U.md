Originally CS:NO (Corny Strike Non-Offensive) on external, depreciated server `GiddyLevi2`. When ported over to CornyCraft, it was rebranded to CS:NO U (Corny Strike Non-Offensive Ultimate). Not all maps have been ported over, the ones that haven't such as Jamanginger as considered lost media. In spite of maps getting lost to time, CS:NO U has the highest map count of any game

<u>Notable Systems</u>
Items, one of the first RNG systems
Non-hardwired multiple maps, makes use of cloning commands

<u>Notable Mechanics</u>
First appearance of many staple weapons, almost every weapon returns, or are referenced in other shooters. LMG, QED, Devwand are the notable unique creations.

<u>Map mixer</u>
A one time experiment where maps from other games could be played
