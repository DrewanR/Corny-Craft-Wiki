## Quick Introduction

`/trigger spawn` Takes you back to the hub

**In the lobby:**
    The purple signs at the very front are the general build areas
    Orange signs are general things, typically builds
    Blue are mini games \[See below\]

**General build areas** are literally what it sounds like, build what you like here. Historically everyone has had op, you can have this if you wish, but everyone will continue to have access to creative mode.
1. [[Old Lands]] were the original area and is a shitshow.
2. [[Gingenstrasse]] was similar but along a street and more recent
3. [[Mt Coronox]] has existed for a matter of weeks, and uses an actual overworld. I would love to see more builds done here

most games operated of a join and leave game system. **Never** forget to leave the game

<u>Quick rules</u>
Treat everyone's work with respect
Any pranks you must be willing to remove
Just dont be a dick
And never `/kill @e`
